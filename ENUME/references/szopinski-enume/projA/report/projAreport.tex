	\section{Abstract}
	
	This project explores the numerical methods of solving systems of linear
	equations and finding eigenvalues of matrices. The following concepts are
	discussed within this document:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computing the machine epsilon of an environment
		\item Solving linear equation systems using Gaussian elimination with
		partial pivoting
		\item Solving linear equation systems using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel
		algorithms
		\item Finding the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix using the QR method
		with and without shifts
	\end{itemize}
	
	\newpage
	
	\section{Task 1: Computing the machine epsilon}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The goal of this task was to find the machine epsilon of the MATLAB
	environment, i.e. the maximum relative error of a floating-point
	representation of a number.
	
	\subsection{Implementation}
	
	The computation of the machine epsilon is based on the following two
	observations:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In binary computer environments, the epsilon is a negative power
		of two.
		\item The machine epsilon can also be expressed as:
		\begin{equation}
			eps = \min\{x \in M: fl(1 + x) > 1 \land x > 0\}
		\end{equation}
		i.e. the smallest representable number such that, when added to $1$,
		has a floating point representation greater than $1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	An arbitrary starting point, in this case $2^0$, can thus be chosen, and its
	value can then be sequentially halved until the criterion $fl(1 + x) > 1$ is
	no longer met.
	
	\subsection{Program output}
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		Found epsilon is 2.2204e-16
		Epsilon is 2.2204e-16
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\subsection{Observations}
	
	An epsilon of $2.2204 \cdot 10^{-16} = 2^{-52}$ is indicative of a standard
	double-precision IEEE 754 floating point binary representation.

	\section{Task 2: Solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian
	elimination}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The task consisted of two subtasks, each specifying a different system
	of equations to solve. The systems were to be solved using Gaussian
	elimination with partial pivoting. The size of the system was sequentially
	doubled until the computation time became prohibitive. The error of each
	solution was to be noted.
	
	Additionally, for systems whose number of equations was equal to 10,
	residual correction was to be applied and the solution was to be noted.
	
	The systems were given by:
	\begin{align*}
		&A_{ij}^{(a)} =
		\begin{cases} 
			4 & \text{for } i = j \\
			1 & \text{for } i = j \pm 1 \\
			0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
		&&
		b_i^{(a)} = 4 + 0.3i
		\\
		&A_{ij}^{(b)} = \frac{6}{7(i + j + 1)}
		&&
		b_i^{(b)} =
		\begin{cases} 
			\frac{1}{3i} & \text{for even } i\\
			0 & \text{for odd } i
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsection{Implementation}
	
	Gaussian elimination is a process that takes a matrix describing a linear
	equation system and returns its LU (lower-upper) decomposition, enabling the
	system to be cheaply solved for any vector $b$. The triangular matrices $L$
	and $U$ can be supplemented with $b$ to find the solution vector $x$ through
	a process called back-substitution.
	
	\subsubsection{LU decomposition of a matrix}
	
	The function \texttt{gausseli} takes an equation system and returns the $L$
	matrix, the $U$ matrix, the permutation matrix $P$ as well as a matrix
	describing the entire system post-elimination, to be immediately handed to
	back-substitution for the calculation of the result.
	
	The elimination itself is done by traveling along the diagonal of
	\texttt{eqsys} and for each encountered cell, eliminating (reducing to $0$)
	the coefficients directly below it. The program does so by multiplying the
	current row by a constant and subtracting it from the rows beneath.
	This constant, called \texttt{reductor} in the code, is given as the
	ratio of the cell to be reduced and the current diagonal cell. The reductor
	is then stored in the $L$ matrix.
	
	\subsubsection{Partial pivoting}
	
	The above algorithm alone is prone to errors when a value on the diagonal is
	equal to $0$ and the reductor cannot be constructed. For this reason,
	partial pivoting is added.
	
	For each cell on the diagonal, the program looks at the cells beneath it and
	finds the one with the greatest absolute value. If it exceeds the absolute
	value of the current cell, the corresponding two rows are swapped. This
	ensures that the divisor making up the reductor is as far from zero as
	possible.
	
	Because the input matrix changes while being decomposed, a permutation
	matrix $P$ is introduced to enable its recomposition from $L$ and $U$,
	satisfying the equation:
	\begin{equation}
		LU = PA
	\end{equation}
	
	Finally, the matrix $L$ is also permuted to reflect changes in the layout
	of the system.
	
	\subsubsection{Back-substitution}
	
	A triangular matrix supplied with a constant vector $b$ can be easily solved
	by traveling along its diagonal and eliminating the factors directly above
	the visited cell. In the end, the matrix is transformed into an identity
	matrix and the vector alongside it is transformed into $x$.
	
	\subsubsection{Residual correction}
	
	Residual correction is a method of improving the accuracy of the results
	obtained from Gaussian elimination. By reusing the already obrained matrices
	$L$, $U$ and $P$, the system is solved once again, this time with $b$
	replaced with the vector of errors of the solution. The resulting vector
	$\delta x$ is then subtracted from the previous solution. This procedure may
	be repeated as needed.

	\subsection{Observations}
	
	Matrices from both subtasks a and b lent themselves nicely to being solved
	using Gaussian elimination. Their absolute errors, when divided by the
	solutions themselves, resulted in very small relative errors, nearing the
	machine epsilon.
	
	The computation time became prohibitive beyond $n = 320$, showing that
	Gaussian elimination is an effective method of solving large systems
	of equations.
	
	Residual correction was very effective for the matrix from subtask a,
	reducing the error to a perfect $0$. For subtask b, on the other hand, no
	matter the amount of iterations, the error could not be reduced any further.
	This might be related to a high condition number of the matrix,
	$2.4225 \cdot 10^{14}$, prohibiting it from producing accurate enough
	results.
	
	\newpage
	\section{Task 3: Solving systems of linear equations using the Jacobi and
	Gauss-Seidel algorithms}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	In this task, a predefined, fixed-size system of equations was to be solved
	using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithms. The algorithms were
	to be iterated until the accuracy $\lVert Ax_k - b \rVert < 10^{-10}$ was
	achieved. The error of each iteration was to be noted.
	
	The system to be solved:
	\begin{align*}
		18x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 + x_4 & = 7\\
		2x_1 - 25x_2 + 5x_3 - 18x^4 & = 12\\
		x_1 + 3x_2 + 13x_3 - 8x_4 & = 24\\
		x_1 + x_2 - 2x_3 - 10x_4 & = 20
	\end{align*}
	
	Afterwards, one of the algorithms was to be applied to matrices from task 2
	a and b, for $n = 10$.
	
	\subsection{Implementation}
	
	The general formula describing iterative methods of solving linear equation
	systems is:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
		x^{(i + 1)} = Mx^{(i)} + w
	\end{equation}
	Where the matrix $M$ and the vector $w$ are specific to the chosen
	algorithm.
	
	\subsubsection{The Jacobi algorithm}
	
	The first step of the Jacobi algorithm is to split the matrix $A$ into three
	matrices: the lower triangular matrix, the upper triangular matrix and the
	diagonal matrix.
	
	Because the diagonal matrix is only ever used in its inverse from, the
	function doing the splitting only returns the inverse diagonal matrix. It
	utilizes the fact that the inverse of a diagonal matrix is a matrix of the
	inverse of its diagonal elements.
	
	Once the matrices $L$, $U$ and $D^{-1}$ have been obtained, the parameters
	$M$ and $w$ are given by:
	\begin{align*}
		M &= -D^{-1}(L + U)\\
		w &= D^{-1}b
	\end{align*}
	
	The step described in \eqref{eq:1} is then performed until the desired
	accuracy is achieved.
	
	\subsubsection{The Gauss-Seidel algorithm}
	
	The Gauss-Seidel algorithm is similar to the Jacobi algorithm in that it
	utilizes the lower, upper and inverse diagonal matrices to calculate
	subsequent iterations. An important difference is that $M$ and $w$ are not
	constant and they cannot be trivially calculated.
	
	An iteration of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm can be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		Dx^{(i + 1)} &= -Lx^{(i + 1)} - (Ux^{(i)} - b)\\
		&= -Lx^{(i + 1)} - w^{(i)}
	\end{align*}
	
	The presence of $x^{(i + 1)}$ on both sides of the equation might appear
	problematic, however, it's crucial to observe that individual elements of
	the vector $x_n^{(i + 1)}$ can be calculated based solely on the knowledge
	of their preceding elements, with $x_1^{(i + 1)}$ being completely
	independent:
	\begin{align*}
		x_1^{(i + 1)} &= (-w_1^{(i)}) \cdot D^{-1}_{11}\\
		x_2^{(i + 1)} &= (-L_{21} \cdot x_1^{(i + 1)} - w_2^{(i)})
		\cdot D^{-1}_{22}\\
		x_3^{(i + 1)} &= (-L_{31} \cdot x_1^{(i + 1)}
		- L_{32} \cdot x_2^{(i + 1)}
		- w_3^{(i)}) \cdot D^{-1}_{33}\\
		&\ldots
	\end{align*}
	
	And so, on each step, the vector $w^{(i)}$ is calculated first, after which
	the elements of $x_n^{(i + 1)}$ are computed in sequence.

	\end{verbatim}
	
	\subsection{Observations}
	
	In both algorithms, the error of the solution decreased exponentially in
	relation to the number of iterations.
	
	The Gauss-Seidel method proved to be faster than the Jacobi method, with the
	desired accuracy achieved in just 32 iterations compared to 43.
	
	The matrix from task 2a was solved correctly. The 2b variant, however, could
	not achieve the desired accuracy and the algorithm became stuck in a
	loop, iterating infinitely in an attempt to reduce the error. This again
	may be related to the high condition number of the matrix, or to the fact
	that the measured error is absolute rather than relative.
	
	\section{Task 4: Finding the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix using the QR
	method}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The problem presented in this task was to find the eigenvalues of a
	symmetric matrix by utilizing the properties of its QR decomposition. Two
	variants of the algorithm were to be used, one with and one without shifting
	the diagonal to accelerate the convergence. The algorithms were to be
	iterated until the off-diagonal elements decreased below the threshold of
	$10^{-6}$. The resultant final matrices were to be printed.
	
	The matrix of choice:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			1 & 1 & 7 & 5 & 2\\
			1 & 8 & 5 & 4 & 4\\
			7 & 5 & 0 & 8 & 8\\
			5 & 4 & 8 & 0 & 8\\
			2 & 4 & 8 & 8 & 1
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Implementation}
	
	The QR method is based on the observation that by repeatedly decomposing the
	matrix into its orthogonal matrix $Q$ and triangular matrix $R$ and
	recomposing it as $R * Q$, the matrix will converge into a diagonal matrix
	of its eigenvalues by means of similarity.
	
	\subsubsection{QR decomposition using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm}
	
	The columns of the input matrix $A$ are orthogonalized with the modified
	Gram-Schmidt algorithm, producing matrices $Q$ and $R$, which can later be
	multiplied together to reverse the process.
	
	The algorithm iterates over the columns of A and orthogonalizes every column
	in front of it with relation to the currently visited column. This is done
	by calculating the dot product of the two columns and using it to subtract
	the ``common part" from the second column. The matrix $Q$ is produced in the
	process, as well as $R$ as a byproduct.
	
	\subsubsection{QR method without shifts}
	
	The QR method for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix without shifts is a
	naive implementation of the observation described at the beginning of this
	section. The matrix is repeatedly decomposed and recomposed until its
	off-diagonal elements converge below the prescribed threshold.
	
	\subsubsection{QR method with shifts}
	
	The QR method may be accelerated by shifting the diagonal of the matrix
	towards an approximation of the expected eigenvalues. The required shift can
	be calculated by finding the eigenvalues of the lower right $2 \times 2$
	sub-matrix and choosing the one closer to the lower right corner of said
	sub-matrix.
	
	The eigenvalues of the sub-matrix can be found by solving the characteristic
	equation of the sub-matrix, $\det{(A - \lambda I)} = 0$. This will result in
	a quadratic equation whose solutions are guaranteed to be real for a
	symmetric matrix.
	
	This shift is applied on every iteration of the algorithm. Once all
	non-diagonal values of the lowermost row of the matrix have decreased below
	the threshold, the matrix is deflated, i.e. its size is reduced by one in
	both dimensions. The algorithm stops once the matrix can't be deflated any
	further.
