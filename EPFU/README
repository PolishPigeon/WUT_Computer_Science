This is a WUT project about creating an AI that can play board game "Hey that's my fish" 
toDo:

feat:
Code to translate "Current board status" from terminal into GameState for bug fixing

fix: Game ending early despite one of the players having possible moves 
Current board status:
  0  1  2  3  4  
0 P1 ~  F2 F3 F3 
1 P2 ~  F3 F3 F2 
2 P1 ~  F3 F2 F3 
3 P2 F2 ~  F2 F2 
4 P1 ~  F3 P2 ~  

Player number 1 score: 10
Player number 2 score: 10

It's a tie!
Should have continued with player two still playing

fix: Picking a penguin that has no moves left changes this penguin into water (???) and then asks player to choose another penguin
